         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>God the abſolute Soveraign Lord and King of all things in Heaven and earth, the original Fountain and cauſe of all cauſes, who is circumſcribed, limited, and governed by no Rules, but doth all things meerly and only by his ſoveraign will and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited good pleaſure, wgo made the world and all things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for his own glory, and who by his own will and pleaſure gave man (his mere Creature) the ſoveraignty (under himſelf) over all the reſt of his Creaturrs, and endued him with a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul or underſtanding, and thereby created him after his own Image, and by his ſoveraign and abſolute creating power, made a female or woman, called <hi>Eve,</hi> which two, and the earthly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Fountain, as begetters and bringers forth of all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, and individual man and woman, that ever breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world ſince, who are and were by nature all alike in power, dignity, Authority and Majeſty, none of them having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authority, Dominion, or Majeſterial power, one over or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, but by inſtitution, or donation, that is to ſay, by mutual agreement or conſent given, derived or aſſumed by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent and agreement, for the good, benefit, and comfort each of other, and not for the miſchief, hurt, or damage of any, it being unnatural, irrational, ſinful, wicked, and unjuſt for any man or men whatſoever, to part with ſo much of their power, as ſhall inable a Prince to deſtroy and undo them therewith.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117806:4"/>
            <p>And unnatural, irrational, ſinful, wicked, unjuſt, develiſh, and tyranical; it is for a Prince to appropriate and aſſume unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a Power, Authority, and jurisdiction to unite, govern, or raign over any ſort of men in the world, without their free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and he that doth it, does thereby as much as in him lies, endeavour to appropriate and aſſume unto himſelf the Office and Soveraignty of GOD, who alone doth, and is to rule by his will and pleaſure. And wickedneſs [in the higheſt] it is for any King to raign and govern by his Prerogative will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; although his late Father <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt, would needs maintain this erroneous maxime, <hi>That Kingdoms are Kings own, and that they may do with them what they will;</hi> as if Kingdoms were for them, and not they for their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Therefore again I ſay, that their ways are wicked, unjuſt, and tyranical; and as it is a great wickedneſs for any ſort of men to ſuffer them ſo to do, ſo it is a great ſin and preſumption of all Gods Saints, if they do not uſe all poſſible means for the caſting off the yoak of uſurpation and tyranny.</p>

            <p>The Goaler hearing this, reproved him, and ſwore by his ſoul he was a mad man, and ſo lockt the doors and departed; but within 2 days after, he came to him again, having heard what the Dream was, and asked him, whither he could expound the Kings Dream, which he formerly told him of; he anſwered yes: well, pray let me hear it then, quoth the Goaler; why ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Douglas,</hi> the ſame night following that he was Crowned, falling into a ſlumber, he dreamed, that he ſhould never wear the Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>The Dream before hinted at is ſaid to be thus, That on the 2. of <hi>Jan.</hi> in the morning, many of the Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> went to give the King a viſit, and coming into his Bed-chamber, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their uſual Cuſtom, ſaid, <hi>Good morrow my Liege for all day;</hi> but finding him to be ſo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That upon the adventuring one Crown, to gain two, he was very doubtful he ſhould hazard the loſſe of 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
